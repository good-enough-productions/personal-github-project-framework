- **Technical Comfort Level:** Comfortable with concepts but need guidance on implementation details

### Current Goals & Projects
- **Primary Goal:** Streamline workflow for creating scripts/processes/automations/apps
- **Challenge:** "I create content faster than I can consume it" - need better knowledge management
- **Active Project:** n8n-ideas - LLM chat interface for converting conversations into n8n workflows
- **Learning Focus:** Local LLMs, automation, workflow optimization, knowledge preservation

### Working Preferences
- **Communication Style:** Explain things in regular English, avoid excessive jargon
- **Detail Level:** Provide context and reasoning, not just commands
- **Learning Approach:** Show me how it works, then let me modify and experiment
- **Problem Solving:** Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps

### What I Want to Build

## Instructions for AI Assistants

### How to Help Me Best
1. **Explain the "why" not just the "how"** - I want to understand the reasoning
2. **Use practical examples** - Real code snippets and real-world scenarios
3. **Suggest improvements gradually** - Don't overwhelm with advanced features initially
4. **Focus on maintainability** - Help me build things I can understand later
5. **Consider my existing tools** - Work with what I already have set up

### Communication Preferences
- **Start with overview, then details** - Give me the big picture first
- **Use analogies and comparisons** - Help me relate new concepts to familiar ones
- **Provide multiple options** - Show me different approaches and trade-offs
- **Include troubleshooting tips** - Anticipate common issues I might encounter
- **Reference documentation** - Point me to reliable sources for deeper learning

### Project Approach
- **Begin with working prototype** - Get something functional quickly
- **Iterate and improve** - Add features in logical progression
- **Document decisions** - Help me understand why we chose specific approaches
- **Plan for future enhancement** - Design with extensibility in mind
- **Consider maintenance** - Build things I can modify and troubleshoot myself

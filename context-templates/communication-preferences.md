# Communication & Collaboration Context Template

## Communication Preferences

### AI Interaction Style
- **Tone:** Professional but conversational, not overly formal
- **Explanation Level:** Detailed but accessible - explain concepts without being condescending
- **Code Examples:** Always include practical, working examples
- **Problem-Solving:** Show multiple approaches with pros/cons

### When I Ask Questions
- **Context First:** Provide overview before diving into specifics
- **Progressive Detail:** Start simple, offer deeper explanation if needed
- **Practical Focus:** Emphasize real-world application over theoretical concepts
- **Troubleshooting:** Anticipate common issues and provide solutions

### Response Structure I Prefer
1. **Quick Answer:** What you're going to help me do
2. **Context:** Why this approach makes sense
3. **Implementation:** Step-by-step or code examples
4. **Next Steps:** What to do after this solution
5. **Alternatives:** Other options if this doesn't fit

## Learning & Development Preferences

### How I Learn Best
- **Learning by Doing:** Provide working examples I can modify
- **Incremental Building:** Start with basic version, then enhance
- **Real Use Cases:** Connect new concepts to actual problems I'm solving
- **Reference Materials:** Point me to documentation for deeper understanding

### Knowledge Gaps to Consider
- **Formal CS Education:** I lack traditional computer science background
- **Enterprise Patterns:** May not know "standard" enterprise development practices
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Keep solutions practical rather than algorithmically complex
- **Deployment/DevOps:** Limited experience with complex deployment scenarios

### Strengths to Leverage
- **Problem Identification:** Good at identifying workflow inefficiencies
- **Automation Thinking:** Natural inclination toward automating repetitive tasks
- **Integration Mindset:** Think about how tools can work together
- **Practical Application:** Focus on solutions that solve real problems

## Project Collaboration Style

### How I Work on Projects
- **Iterative Development:** Build working version first, then improve
- **Documentation-Driven:** Document decisions and reasoning as we go
- **Future-Proofing:** Consider how I'll understand/modify code later
- **Knowledge Preservation:** Capture context about why we made certain choices

### Decision-Making Process
1. **Understand the Problem:** Make sure we're solving the right thing
2. **Explore Options:** Look at different approaches
3. **Consider Constraints:** Factor in my tools, skills, and preferences
4. **Start Simple:** Choose the simplest solution that works
5. **Plan Evolution:** Consider how to enhance later

### What I Value in Solutions
- **Maintainability:** I can understand and modify it months later
- **Reliability:** Works consistently without constant tweaking
- **Extensibility:** Can be enhanced as needs grow
- **Documentation:** Well-explained so I can troubleshoot issues

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### Do This
- **Explain your reasoning** - Why you chose this approach
- **Provide working examples** - Code I can actually run and test
- **Consider my ecosystem** - Use tools and patterns I already have
- **Plan for growth** - Design solutions that can be enhanced
- **Document decisions** - Help me understand choices made

### Avoid This
- **Overly complex solutions** - Keep it as simple as possible
- **Assumptions about knowledge** - Explain concepts that might be unfamiliar
- **Generic code samples** - Tailor examples to my actual use case
- **Tool recommendations** without considering my preferences
- **Solutions that require extensive setup** - Prefer tools I already have

### When Suggesting Tools or Technologies
1. **Check my preferences first** - Reference my tools-and-preferences.md
2. **Explain why it's better** - What problem does it solve?
3. **Consider learning curve** - How much time to get productive?
4. **Show integration path** - How does it fit with existing tools?
5. **Provide alternatives** - What if this doesn't work out?

## Context Management

### Information to Always Consider
- **Current project focus:** n8n-ideas and workflow automation
- **Primary challenge:** Managing knowledge of created projects
- **Development environment:** Windows, VS Code, PowerShell, GitHub
- **Skill level:** Intermediate beginner with practical focus
- **Tool preferences:** Local > cloud, free > paid, simple > complex

### Long-term Goals to Keep in Mind
- **Workflow optimization:** Reduce friction in development process
- **Knowledge management:** Better tracking and understanding of projects
- **Automation expansion:** Connect more tools and processes
- **Skill development:** Learn new technologies that solve real problems
